##BMI Challenge
###Week Two Javascript Challenge

Purpose
----------
This incredibly basic app calculates BMI based on either metric or imperial inputs, plus cursing.

Notes
----------
* You don't need to enter a 0 if you are 6'0, it will just go through. Likewise, if you accidentally hit enter before you get to inches, it will calculate based on just the feet.
* BMI is sort of a crap way of determining "healthy" weight, so results should be taken even less seriously than presented.
* Based on "real" BMI results:
  * "Too Skinny" =  "Underweight"
  * "Still Too Skinny" = "Normal"
  * "in need of a few more hamburgers" = "Overweight"
  * "American" = "Obese"

###Happy self-hating!
